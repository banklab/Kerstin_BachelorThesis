This repository contains the bioinformatic analyses performed to investigate the genomic organization of antibiotic resistance genes (AMR) in cattle-dervide E. coli isolates from Swiss farms. Based on the provided long-read assemblies and annotation files, the AMR gene loci were converted to BED format for comparative visualization. Gene arrangements were examined in relation to nearby mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and context files from PlasmidFinder and IntegronFinder were analyzed to distinguish between plasmid-associated and chromosomal resistance regions. Selected genes (folP, acrR, marR) were extracted for mutation analysis to assess possible effects on efflux regulation.
